The government has announced additional payments under the Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia (BKM) Tambahan scheme for eligible bottom 40 (B40) recipients.

According to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, a further RM630 million had been allocated to be paid out together with the second phase of BKM payments starting on 27 June.

“Taking into consideration the challenges of the cost of living and the recent rise in food prices, the government has decided to prepare additional cash aid for the B40 group. 

“Each B40 household will receive an additional RM100, while single recipients will receive RM50 under this additional aid,” Ismail said.


The Bera MP said that the scheme will benefit almost 8.6 million recipients.

“These recipients include 4 million households, 1.2 million senior citizens (single/without spouse) and 3.4 million single individuals,” Ismail told a press conference in Putrajaya today.

Ismail also said that the additional BKM allocation is expected to ease the financial burden of the B40 group in preparations for the upcoming Aidiladha.

Ismail said a total of 8.6 million BKM recipients have been approved and households will receive up to RM2,500 in 2022.
