THE Pakatan Harapan (PH) Presidential Council will meet Prime Minister (PM) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to press for the tabling of the Anti-Party Hopping Bill.

The coalition leaders said they were disappointed with the government’s failure to convene a special parliamentary meeting specifically to table the Anti-Party Hopping Bill.

“We hope that the bill can be tabled in the first week of the Dewan Rakyat session starting from July 18,” they said in a joint statement today.

According to the PH leaders, the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between them and the federal government states that all 18 articles must be implemented within six months.

The three outstanding articles include limiting the PM to two terms or 10 years in office; putting forward the parliamentary service bill; and changing the rules of procedure of the House of Representatives.

By approving this bill, 15 of the 18 or 83% articles in the MoU will be achieved.

“Therefore, the main leadership of PH will hold an immediate meeting with the PM to discuss the Anti-Party Hopping Bill and the above matters,” the statement reads.

The statement was signed by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Anthony Loke, Datuk Seri Madius Tangau and Mohamad Sabu, representing PKR, DAP, the United Progressive Kinabalu Organisation and Parti Amanah Negara, respectively.
