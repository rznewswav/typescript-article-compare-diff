KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 — Bursa Malaysia rebounded to start on a higher note today, climbing slightly above the 1,440 mark on improved buying interest in selected heavyweights led by plantation stocks, a dealer said.

At 9.06am, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) widened 9.01 points to 1,440.11 from Wednesday's close of 1,431.10.

The benchmark index opened 3.40 points steadier at 1,434.50.

Market breadth was positive with gainers leading losers 137 to 96, while 184 counters were unchanged, 1,849 untraded and nine others suspended.

Turnover stood at 144.93 million units worth RM60.99 million.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said a mild rebound is anticipated today as the index is hovering close to its support level.

"We expect the local bourse to trend within the range of 1,425-1,445 throughout the day,” he told Bernama.

On the Wall Street overnight performance, he said all three major indices closed lower and market undertone was cautious as inflationary concerns remain a major headwind.
